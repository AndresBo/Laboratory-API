# Laboratory-API
API webserver project: build a web server for a Laboratory that helps keep track of day-to-day operations.

Laboratories report patient data (results and patient details) but often cannot track day-to-day operation data like:
- Who was the analyst who prepared a run (batch of tests)
- What analyzer was used to run a test/request

Often day-to-day data is tracked using paper or at best a spreadsheet. This takes a lot of time and effort and is unreliable. My aim is to build and API that can track this data.

Core functionality would allow an analyst to:
1. Create a request
2. Read a request
3. Update a request
4. Delete a request
