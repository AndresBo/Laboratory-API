# Laboratory-API
API webserver project: build a web server for a laboratory that helps keep track of day-to-day operations. Often laboratories keep track of patient data but cannot track data like:
- Who was the analyst who prepared a run
- What analyzer was used to run a test/request

Quite often day to day data is tracked using paper or at best a spreadsheet. This takes a lot of time and effort and is unreliable.
